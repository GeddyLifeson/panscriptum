"""DRILL — attack every safety net in the library and report which ones actually held.

WHY. This project's most expensive recurring lesson is that *a check that cannot fail looks
exactly like a check that passed* (standing lesson 9). A guard nobody has watched REFUSE is a
guard nobody has evidence about. Verify_math asserts that the guards exist and behave on
synthetic inputs; this goes further and tries to get PAST each one, in the shape a real failure
would take, and reports HELD or BREACHED for every net individually.

The owner's framing, and it is the right one: the coaster has failsafes, and so do the track, the
lift chain, the dispatch electronics, the loading platform, the queue line, the building, and the
people operating it after hours. A drill that only tests the restraints is a drill that has
tested one of eight things.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It never writes to the corpus, never calls a model, and never opens the
prose gate. Every attack is constructed in memory or in a scratch directory. `--to-halt` is the
one exception and is opt-in: it ends the drill by raising a REAL halt, so the top rung is
observed firing rather than assumed to work, and the owner clears it by hand.

Usage:
    python src/drill.py                 # attack every net, report, change nothing
    python src/drill.py --to-halt       # ... and finish by genuinely halting the library
