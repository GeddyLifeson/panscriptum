# Handoff Log — the maintenance-pass run journal

*One dated entry per maintenance run, newest on top. This is the RUN LOG only; the project's
deep engineering history, doctrine, and architecture live in `handoff/HANDOFF.md` (decision
recorded run #1: two files, two jobs — a run journal and a reference book do not share a
writer). Bug ledger: `BUGS.md`. Priority queue for the next run: `NEXT_STEPS.md`. The working
tree is not itself a git repo — commits happen through `src/publish.py --push` into the export
repo (`PANSCRIPTUM_EXPORT`), so "commit hash" below means an export-repo hash.*

## 2026-08-23 late — Run #2, triggered by commit d33d23c

**Flagged for human review:** none new. dandwiki, disk*, hostless-roll, paid-burst-lane
carry over unchanged from run #1 (*disk resolved itself this run — see Resolved).

**Delegation ladder used as specified:** repo bots' own outputs read first (FOR_OWNER.md,
ALLSWEEP.json, OVERWATCH.json, failures.json/failure_samples.json — all fresh, none stale);
Ollama routed via `overwatch.py --modules 14` (hit a GPU-contention window, correctly fell
back to cloud per its own design — not a defect, no action taken); four sonnet subagents
fanned out over surfaces the round-1/evening audits hadn't covered (derivation/rigor/
handbuilt; sweep/endpoint/wiki_source/coverage; build_terminal/weave/weave_index/navtree/
render; pipeline.py+ledger.py+thread_integrity.py — ~76KB core file, read whole). Every
finding was verified against source (ran the actual code, not just read it) before any fix
landed — see the code comments left at each fix site explaining what was verified and how.

**Resolved this run (root causes, all independently reproduced before fixing):**
- **`cascade_bridge._bury()` raised `UnboundLocalError` on every call** — a dead `if _DEAD is
  None: _DEAD = {}` guard turned `_DEAD` local-by-assignment for the whole function scope, so
  the read one line above it threw before any provider could be benched. Both call sites sit in
  a bare `try/finally` with no `except`, so the error propagated out of the whole cascade call
  uncaught. This is the mechanism behind the exhausted/401-ing providers cycling back into
  rotation every few minutes that OPERATIONAL notes have been describing as "the meter, not the
  code" — it was partly the code. Reproduced by direct call before and after; strike-benching,
  auth-benching, `_alive`, and `_clear` all verified end-to-end post-fix.
- **Phase-1/phase-2 band gates accepted a fabricated Assay decimal** — `re.match(...)\b` is
  start-anchored only, and `\b` is satisfied by a `.`, so `"M4.31 +/- 0.30"` matched and
  `group(1)` returned a laundered `"M4"` — exactly the fabrication both call sites' own
  comments say must be refused. Replaced with `pipeline.clean_band()` (full-match, strict) at
  both acceptance sites, and a separate `pipeline.ceiling_band()` (still lenient, since the
  ceiling clamp can only ever lower a band and refusing to read a legacy dirty ceiling would
  silently drop the clamp for the oldest records). Verified against a dozen inputs including
  clean bands, decimals, prose, `None`, `M11`, and whitespace.
- **`write_record`/`write_record_catalogue` discarded `silence.replace_retry`'s return value**
  — on persistent Windows rename-denial the write silently doesn't land, but both entrypass and
  synthesis marked the unit done regardless (the `done_keys` resume gate then skips it
  forever). Both writers now return whether the rename landed (`pipeline._landed`), and both
  call sites gate `done_keys`/`failed` on that result — a denied write now stays open for the
  next run exactly like an unfinished batch already does, instead of vanishing. Verified with
  a monkeypatched `replace_retry` forced to return `False`.
- **`handbuilt.py` crashed before writing its own artifact** — `moth_number` opens with U+1D504
  (FRAKTUR CAPITAL A), and the report loop that prints it ran before the `json.dump`, so on
  this machine's cp1252 console `python src/handbuilt.py` died with `UnicodeEncodeError`
  mid-report and `data/HANDBUILT_ASSAYS.json` silently stopped regenerating (it had been stale
  since 2026-08-22 20:50). Write now happens first, console reconfigures to UTF-8 with
  `errors="replace"` after. Reproduced the original crash, then reproduced a clean run and
  confirmed the artifact's mtime moved.
- **`rigor.bradley_terry()`'s `undefeated`/`winless` always empty under regularisation** — the
  symmetric prior was folded into `W` before those two lists were computed from it, so any
  `prior > 0` gives every entrant a nonzero row and column sum by construction. Now computed
  from a pre-prior `observed` copy. Reproduced with a 4-entrant all-A-wins fixture at
  `prior=0.0` (correct) vs `prior=1.0` (was `[]`/`[]`, now correct).
- **`rigor.mathematical_resonance()`'s returned `load_bearing` field capped at 8** — Hard Rule
  0: a returned field, not a display string: `sorted(...)[:8]` silently dropped everything past
  the 8th quantity. Uncapped; console `main()` still slices for its own printout. Verified the
  full ledger returns 75 entries now, self-test still prints correctly.
- **stale `silence.note()` line label** at `derivation.py:490` (labeled `:488`) — renamed to a
  content label (`scan_constants-parse`) so it can't drift again.
- **`render.children_of()`'s child-tier gate asserted a schema instead of reading the tree** —
  `child_tier not in SF.TIERS` happens to agree with the current SEVENFOLD.json (which stops at
  `universe`) but would silently keep returning `[]` for `universe` even after galaxy
  coordinates are charted. Changed to `child_tier is None`, letting the per-entry
  `child_tier not in c` check (already present) do the honest work off the actual tree. Traced
  all 9 tiers against a real coordinate before and after — identical child counts, `render.py`
  self-test ("all 9 tiers viewable") still passes. Dropped the now-dead `sevenfold` import
  (pyflakes was clean before touching this file and stayed clean after).
- **[minor] disk pressure (BUGS M2)** — resolved itself between runs; `allsweep` now reports
  135 GB free (was ~5 GB). No action taken by this run; moved to paper trail.
- **`identity.adjudicate()` deleted** (was src/identity.py:321-367) — flagged dead in run #1's
  audit (superseded by `chain.adjudicate_mutuals()`), re-verified dead this run (fresh grep:
  no callers, `winner_epoch` never read anywhere) per the run #1 guardrail ("flagged this run,
  execute next"). `epoch_of()` above it stays — `chain.py:381` calls it directly.

**Findings surfaced but NOT changed (documented, not "fixed"):**
- `thread_integrity.py`'s `implied_threads()`/`classify()` — `pairs` is built symmetrically by
  construction, so every implied thread classifies RECIPROCAL and the ASYMMETRIC-LAWFUL/
  -SUSPECT branches (and the propagation-distance "lawful excuse" logic) are structurally
  unreachable; `DANGLING` is a documented output category that's never computed. This is a
  design-shaped question (is the module meant to compare against a directed thread graph it
  isn't given?), not a one-line fix — added to NEXT_STEPS for review.
- `completeness.py category_size()` — a source whose every category probe hits `URLError`
  returns `None` from `work()` and vanishes from `COMPLETENESS.json` entirely, rather than
  landing in the `unreliable` bucket the module's own docstring says exists for exactly this.
  313 `URLError`s recorded against this site. Added to NEXT_STEPS.
- `wiki_source.page_text()` — a transient exception fetching section 0 returns `""`
  immediately instead of trying sections 1/2, reproducing the exact "transient network hiccup
  read as genuine silence" failure shape `silence.py`'s own header essay warns about. Added to
  NEXT_STEPS.
- `wiki_source.py:278` used as the `silence.note()` label for two semantically unrelated
  failure sites (a local `WIKI_HOSTS.json` read and a live per-candidate category probe) —
  ledger key collision, not a behavior bug. Added to NEXT_STEPS.
- `pipeline.py` phase_cosmology/history/shelve/weave/write write 9 shared, cross-phase-read
  JSON files (`TIERS.json`, `GROUNDINGS.json`, `CENSUS.json`, `SHELFMARKS.json`,
  `CHRONICLE.json`, `SHELVES.json`, `manifest.json`, plus weave's four outputs) with a raw
  `open+json.dump`, not through `_landed`/`replace_retry` — inconsistent with the discipline
  just extended to `write_record`. Medium surgery (9 call sites); added to NEXT_STEPS rather
  than rushed in this run.
- `pipeline.py phase_synthesis` samples only 14 entities (by feat-count then description
  length) to nominate a source's power ceiling, which then hard-clamps every entry in that
  source — if the true ceiling entity has no mined feats, every other entry gets clamped
  against a lesser nominee. UNCERTAIN whether this is Hard-Rule-0-shaped or a design tradeoff;
  added to NEXT_STEPS as a question, not a fix.
- `pipeline.py phase_entrypass` marks `catalogued=True` unconditionally even when `topic` fails
  its enum check (no fallback, unlike `magnitude`'s explicit `unassayed`) — entry becomes
  permanently topicless via the `done_keys` resume gate. Added to NEXT_STEPS.
- `build_terminal.py` interpolates catalogue-derived text into `innerHTML` unescaped
  everywhere, and splices `NAVTREE.json` into a `<script>` block via a plain string replace
  with no `</script>`-sequence guard — `render.py`'s `containment_svg()` already does this
  correctly (`html.escape()`) elsewhere in the same codebase, so the fix pattern exists.
  Real, but a multi-site JS-generation change; added to NEXT_STEPS rather than rushed.
- `build_terminal.py`'s side-panel "Shelved here, not yet catalogued" note truncates to the
  first 8 sources with no "+N more" (Hard Rule 0, display-layer) — small, targeted fix; added
  to NEXT_STEPS.
- `build_terminal.py`'s "contains" row uses `a||b||c` instead of summing branch-children and
  directly-shelved sources — undercounts a node holding both. Added to NEXT_STEPS.
- `navtree.py sources_under()`'s `key.startswith(path)` arm has no `.`-boundary check (the
  sibling arm does), so e.g. key `"0.1.20"` can false-match path `"0.1.2"` and pollute that
  branch's naming register with an unrelated sibling's sources. Added to NEXT_STEPS.
- `weave_index.py designations()` caches forever with no invalidation, unlike its sibling
  `load_records()` which is signature-keyed — low exposure today (its one caller never varies
  the arg) but a real stale-cache pattern. Added to NEXT_STEPS.
- `weave.py`'s per-pair `shared_sample` (capped 8-then-6) is diagnostic evidence for why two
  shelves were linked, not a reader-facing catalogue listing — flagged as Hard-Rule-0-adjacent
  for an owner call rather than assumed in scope. Added to NEXT_STEPS.
- `endpoint.py fetch_raw` lumps every HTTPError (403/429/500, not just 404) into "page doesn't
  exist"; `endpoint.py register()` mutates `SOURCE_PAGES.json` without the lock `ENDPOINTS.json`
  uses in the same file. Both UNCERTAIN/low — added to NEXT_STEPS.
- `handbuilt.py`'s own artifact write was still non-atomic (raw `open+json.dump`, no
  `replace_retry`) even after the ordering fix above — no live second writer today, so lower
  priority than the ordering bug; added to NEXT_STEPS.

**Battery (post-fix):** verify_math 272/272 · allsweep 0 subsystems bad · pyflakes clean in
`src/` (one pre-existing, out-of-scope finding in `src/deprecated/`) · silence audit 331
handlers, 10 silent (unchanged roster, all previously reviewed) · health.py --preflight: 2
pre-existing/known issues (fandom transient unreachability; dandwiki empty cache, BUGS M1) plus
5 entries stranded in closed batches — new count, not investigated this run (pipeline.py was
live and being edited concurrently; flagged to NEXT_STEPS rather than chased mid-run).

**Repo health:** Ollama up (9 models), Cascade 4 usable buckets, disk 135 GB free (BUGS M2
resolved). Export git log confirms `publish.py --push`'s earlier `RuntimeError` (rejected
push, "fetch first", recorded 21:51/22:01/22:11) had already self-resolved by the time this run
checked (`main`/`origin/main` 0/0 apart) — no action needed, noting for the record since it hit
the silent-failure ledger 3x.

**Notes:** four subagents this run, all sonnet-tier, all read-only until findings came back to
this session for source-verification — matching last run's stated discipline ("agents propose,
verify before fixing"). No caps introduced anywhere; two existing caps (`weave.py` shared_sample,
`build_terminal.py`'s 8-source note) flagged rather than silently left in scope-creep territory.

## 2026-08-23 — Run #1, triggered by commit b16f631

**Flagged for human review:** dandwiki HTML-reader decision (BUGS M1); disk at ~5 GB free
(BUGS M2); permanently hostless roll entries; `identity.adjudicate` deletion proposed for
next run (NEXT_STEPS 6); `assay.assay()` gained an OPTIONAL `weights=` kwarg (additive,
default None, no caller broken — noting per the signature guardrail).

**Resolved this run:** the full round-1 + round-2 audit findings — see BUGS.md's paper-trail
section for root causes and commits. Headlines: the two-writer contract got its second,
direction-aware writer after `write_record` silently discarded the doc-ingest's first finds;
`silence.replace_retry` now guards every reader-raced state file; evidence caches self-heal;
custodes' shared-WEIGHTS mutation localized; the terminal's invisible `--dim` labels fixed;
`config.yaml` writes atomic; endpoint cache writes locked.

**New machinery this run:** the maintenance framework itself (`MAINTENANCE.md`, this journal,
`BUGS.md`, `NEXT_STEPS.md`, hourly scheduled task `panscriptum-maintenance`); the supervisor
keeper thread; `write_record_catalogue`; verify_math §18c (merge directions) → 272 checks;
`module_index.py` + `handoff/MODULE_INDEX.md`; `handoff/PHASE_CONTRACTS.md`; descriptive
export commit messages; `ingest_doc.py` (owner-supplied books → corpus, `doc:` host sentinel).

**Optimizations (measured):** standards.check ~146 PowerShell spawns → one 3s-TTL
enumeration, 2.3s/call; chain.harvest 900MB re-parse → incremental index, 3.1s warm;
coverage.measure full-corpus deserialize → mtime cache, 15.6s→6.9s warm; completeness
~1,300 fandom calls per foreman round → 12h disk cache; publish sync ~2GB/day of
unconditional copies → mtime short-circuit; dashboard library/watch on a 5s poll → 30s TTL;
by_axis 3× regex redundancy hoisted; chain per-sentence 54KB DESIGNATORS reload → loaded
once; zstd 19→10.

**Repo health:** verify_math 272/272 · 88/88 modules compile+import · pyflakes clean ·
allsweep 0 bad subsystems · standards ~24-25/37 met (reds: evening pool tide, deliberately
unsatisfiable floors, and items in BUGS.md) · open bugs: 2 major (both human-gated),
2 minor, 3 watching.

**Notes:** the scheduler floors recurring tasks at hourly — that IS "as often as possible"
here; the overlap guard plus the repo's continuous machinery covers the gaps. The evening
free-tier pool is the throughput ceiling tonight; the midnight window reset feeds the
deferred backlog, the charter regression, and the Dragonlords miner without supervision.
