## What the model found in the code

**2 open** (0 high). Newest first.

- **health.py** `return 1 if reopen_stranded(dry=not a.go) is None else 0` — [MEDIUM] return 1 if the result of reopen_stranded is None else 0
  - says: return 1 if the result of reopen_stranded is None else 0
- **feats.py** `main` — [MEDIUM] returns 0 or 1 based on the roll's success, but the comment claims it should follow the same pattern as `--hosts` and `resolve_hosts` which return 1 if _HOSTS_DENIED else 0 and exit nonzero on failure
  - says: the sibling branches in this same file already do it: `--hosts` twenty lines up returns `1 if _HOSTS_DENIED else 0`, and `resolve_hosts`'s own docstring promises "main() exits nonzero on it". `--roll` was the one place the pattern was never applied, even though `roll()` has always returned exactly the counters needed.

Written by `src/overwatch.py`. Structure is checked every round; the model reads modules that changed first, then whichever has gone longest unread. A finding stays open until the file it points at changes.
