## What the model found in the code

**6 open** (0 high). Newest first.

- **ingest_doc.py** `landed_found` — [MEDIUM] landed_found is initialized to state['found'], which may not have been written to disk and thus may not reflect the actual value on disk
  - says: landed_found tracks the value that last actually landed
- **ingest_doc.py** `state` — [MEDIUM] state is initialized to a default value if an exception occurs during loading, but the code does not handle specific exceptions like FileNotFoundError
  - says: state is initialized to a default value if the file is not found
- **hostcheck.py** `sweep` — [MEDIUM] searches for replacements for hosts that failed to hold their fiction but uses a flawed logic for selecting replacements
  - says: searches for replacements for hosts that failed to hold their fiction
- **health.py** `reopen_stranded` — [MEDIUM] return value is used to determine exit code, but the code does not handle the case where it returns None
  - says: THE VERDICT IS THE EXIT CODE (sweep42-batch10). This discarded `reopen_stranded()`'s return value and returned 0 unconditionally, so a repair that could not read or write PIPELINE_STATE.json reported success to whatever ran it -- the check-that-cannot-fail shape, on a repair.
- **entity_match.py** `qualifier_compatible` — [MEDIUM] Returns True if both qualifiers are None or their normalized forms are equal, but does not handle cases where one qualifier is None and the other is not.
  - says: Two names may only be compared if their qualifiers agree.
- **ingest_doc.py** `mine` — [MEDIUM] mine(a.source) is called but its return value is not checked for the early stops conditions
  - says: mine(a.source) returns True only when every chunk was processed, and False on both of its early stops
