## What the model found in the code

**16 open** (4 high). Newest first.

- **completeness.py** `no_denominator` — [HIGH] A ROW THAT COULD NOT BE MEASURED IS A ROW WITH NOTHING IN IT. The code returns a row with the no_denominator message instead of None, which is read downstream as "this source has n
  - says: A ROW THAT COULD NOT BE MEASURED IS NOT A ROW WITH NOTHING IN IT. Returning None here for an all-errors source deleted it from COMPLETENESS.json, and an absent 
- **chain.py** `work` — [HIGH] increments `unmatched` directly without locking, risking race conditions
  - says: TALLIED LOCALLY, MERGED UNDER THE LOCK, for the same reason `local` exists.
- **binding_health.py** `verdict` — [HIGH] The verdict function is not properly handling the absent probe's three possible outcomes (None, False, True), leading to incorrect classification of host faults.
  - says: The three probe outcomes -> (healthy, reason).
- **genre.py** `classify_source` — [HIGH] Truncates the entry list in stored order, changing the answer for 7 of 210 sources
  - says: Classify one source from its own catalogued entries.
- **descending_ladder.py** `shrink_report` — [MEDIUM] The function does not enforce that `to_m` is less than `from_m` (i.e., it does not ensure it's a descent), but instead reports `is_descent` as a boolean based on the input values.
  - says: Full accounting of a mass-conserving descent. Returns the physics, and the verdict.
- **dashboard.py** `movement` — [MEDIUM] Computes deltas between the current sample and the oldest sample within the MOVED_WINDOW_MIN window, but the comment and docstring suggest it should compute changes relative to the
  - says: What has CHANGED, not what the level is.
- **dashboard.py** `quotas` — [MEDIUM] Returns only the status of models in the 'cascade' system, ignoring other potential sources of quota information.
  - says: Every window on every bucket, and which one is actually binding.
- **catalogue_web.py** `catalogue` — [MEDIUM] catalogue a source's pages but the function is named 'catalogue' and the code is correct
  - says: catalogue a source's pages
- **corpus_db.py** `con.execute` — [MEDIUM] INSERT OR REPLACE INTO source VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)
  - says: INSERT OR REPLACE INTO source VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)
- **corpus_db.py** `age_seconds` — [MEDIUM] Returns the time since the index was built, but does not handle cases where the index is locked or corrupt, which can result in None being returned incorrectly
  - says: How old the index is in seconds, or None. -> float|None.
- **cleanup.py** `changed` — [MEDIUM] set in three branches but not used in the fourth, leading to potential missed updates
  - says: tracking whether any changes were made to a record
- **chain.py** `work` — [MEDIUM] uses `chunk[min(i, len(chunk) - 1)]` to attribute outcomes to sentences, which may still be incorrect
  - says: Every outcome after the first skipped sentence was therefore attributed to the wrong sentence, and inherited the wrong page and the wrong CONTINUITY.
- **backfill.py** `F.api` — [MEDIUM] returns None on timeout or nothing found
  - says: used to fold that into an empty page list here too
- **backfill.py** `lead` — [MEDIUM] extract a lead sentence from a block of text
  - says: take the lead from there
- **autostart.py** `subprocess.Popen` — [MEDIUM] returns a subprocess.Popen object immediately without waiting for it to complete
  - says: launches a subprocess
- **assay.py** `sigma` — [MEDIUM] clamp the sigma value to SIGMA_MAX but the code does not handle the case where sigma is None
  - says: clamp the sigma value to SIGMA_MAX
