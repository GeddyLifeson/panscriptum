# Bug Ledger

*Open bugs by severity (blocking > major > minor > cosmetic). Resolved bugs move to the
bottom with root cause and the export-repo commit that fixed them — a paper trail, never a
deletion. Maintained by the maintenance pass; humans welcome to add.*

## Open

### Major
- **[M1] dandwiki.com is API-blocked (HTTP 403 to every non-browser client)** — 4 homebrew
  sources unhosted; HTML answers a browser UA, so a design decision is needed: build an
  HTML-path reader with a browser UA (politeness/ToS question — HUMAN CALL) or leave the four
  sources owner-supplied. Noted in `data/SCOUT_BLOCKED.json`. Not auto-fixable.
- **[M2] Machine drive at ~5 GB free** (floor: 10) — the project occupies ~1 GB total, so the
  pressure is elsewhere on the disk. The roll writes hundreds of MB/hour when healthy.
  HUMAN CALL: clear non-project space or move the corpus. Standard `disk` is red.

### Minor
- **[m1] Marvel completeness row 25h stale** (0.4% vs 30,207 on disk) — re-measure was
  launched this run (`completeness.py --workers 6`); verify the row after it lands. If still
  wrong after a fresh run, the byslug matching in `completeness.py` becomes a real suspect.
- **[m2] `sources on the roll but never catalogued`: 6** (HAWX, Heaven's Lost Property, Lost
  Mines of Phandelver, Twilight Imperium, +2) and **16 catalogued sources with no host** —
  scout/adopt remedies keep retrying; some (music albums, board games) may be permanently
  hostless and deserve an owner ruling on whether they stay on the roll.

## Watching (not bugs — expected states with a clock on them)
- Charter regression first run dispatched autonomously 21:31 (`magnitude.py --calibrate`,
  foreman AUTO). Verify `data/CHARTER_REGRESSION.json` lands and the standard flips.
- Dragonlords ingest miner: patient loop (60-miss ≈ 5h), waiting out the evening pool for the
  midnight free-tier window. Cursor at chunk 1/252 after the writer fix.
- Deferred assay backlog (heavyweights, Jace accessions, Infinity Gauntlet) self-requeues
  when the pool window rolls.

## Resolved (paper trail)

*Run #1 (2026-08-23, commits fc390a9…b16f631). Root causes one line each:*

- **ingest_doc used `write_record` (disk-wins merge) and its first 14 finds were discarded** —
  wrong side of the two-writer contract; → `write_record_catalogue`, cursor reset, both merge
  directions pinned by verify_math §18c (b16f631).
- **`os.replace` PermissionError killed an assay worker mid-batch** — Windows denies rename
  while a reader holds the target; → `silence.replace_retry` shared helper on every
  reader-raced state file (fc390a9).
- **standards' floors self-check blind to a dead floor** — substring match defeated by a
  comment mention and a prefix collision (`MAX_UNANSWERED[_RECORDS]`); → word-bounded,
  comment-stripped matcher; dead floor deleted (fc390a9).
- **Catalogue tools wrote records raw** (truncating, non-atomic, racing the pipeline) — →
  routed through the new catalogue-side merge writer (fc390a9).
- **feats/read evidence caches: truncated file = permanent silent entity loss** — unguarded
  json.load of a cache killed mid-write; → atomic writes + self-healing reads (fc390a9).
- **`_WIDEN_RR` rotation cursor raced by worker threads** — re-pinned the pool to one bucket;
  → locked (fc390a9).
- **`foreman._retire` truncating write on overwatch's ledger** — → atomic (fc390a9).
- **`restart_reader` never restarted anything** (both branches returned without acting) and
  **both foreman process-killers filtered `python.exe` only** (jobs run under pythonw) — →
  reader bounce implemented; filters widened (fc390a9).
- **standings jobs stayed down for hours after a mid-cycle death** — the cycle only re-asserts
  at its top, then blocks in run/join; → keeper thread re-asserts every 5 min (d4745fa).
- **`silence.py --instrument` resurrected the 5,672-row probe-noise ledger class** — the
  rewriter can't distinguish deliberate silence; → `silence-exempt` string markers honoured by
  both audit and instrumenter (fc390a9).
- **Epoch-mandate bypass through the split retry** (morning); **split-gate accepted fabricated
  wrappers**; **entry bands could exceed their source's ceiling** (Starkiller Base M5 in M4)
  — all gated/clamped; reconcile check added (earlier commits, same day).
- **~146 PowerShell spawns per standards.check** (dashboard polls it at 5s) — one shared
  enumeration, 3s TTL, invalidated on launch; check now 2.3s (d4745fa).
- **chain.harvest re-parsed 56k files/900MB per cycle** — incremental mtime index; 3.1s warm
  (fc390a9). **weave_index.load_records re-parsed 63MB per dashboard poll** — signature cache
  (fc390a9). **13MB sweep parsed twice per batch** — once (fc390a9).
